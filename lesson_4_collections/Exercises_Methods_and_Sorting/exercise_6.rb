# What is the return value of the following statement? Why?

# ['ant', 'bear', 'caterpillar'].pop.size

# Answer:
# => 11

# Pop removes the last element from this array. Then, size evaluates the return value of the popped element.
# So, in this case, the string 'caterpillar' is 11 characters long.
