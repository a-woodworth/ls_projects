# One of the most frequently used real-world string properties is that of "string substitution", where we take a hard-coded string and modify it with various parameters from our program.

# Given this previously seen family hash, print out the name, age and gender of each family member:

munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}
# ...like this:

# (Name) is a (age)-year-old (male or female).

munsters.each do |name, details|
  puts "#{name} is a #{details['age']}-year-old #{details['gender']}."
end

# Herman is a 32-year-old male.
# Lily is a 30-year-old female.
# Grandpa is a 402-year-old male.
# Eddie is a 10-year-old male.
# Marilyn is a 23-year-old female.
